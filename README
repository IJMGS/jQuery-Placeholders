jQuery Placeholders V1.0

README

Not much to say, just run it through your site using

$(document).placeholders();

The script will check it's IE, and if it is will generate an object
containing the default values of the inputs that have the placeholders.

After on, it'll bind the focus in and focus out events to correctly
remove the placeholder or show it in case of leaving the input and not
writing anything
